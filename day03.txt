1.JSON iterate over for loops: 
 
JSON: 
  *JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.  
  *It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).  
  *You'll come across it quite often, so in this article we give you all you need to work with JSON using JavaScript, including parsing JSON so you can access data within it, and creating JSON. 
 
 1. for in loop;
  var person={ 
    name:"kavin", 
    age:22, 
    gender:"male", 
    degree:"agriculture"
} 
for(var key in person) { 
    console.log(key+":"+person[key])
} 
 
2.Difference between windows,screen,object in JavaScript: 
  WINDOW
   * Window is the main JavaScript object root,  the global object in a browser, also can be treated as the root of the document object model.
   * You can access it as window.Well, the window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. 
   * This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
                

  DOCUMENT
   * The Document object(DOM) is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser.
   * The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.  
   * What does this really mean? That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.
  SCREEN
   * The Window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:
   * screen properties width and height are the full screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar window.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.
